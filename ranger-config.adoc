=== Step 1.2: Verify permissions in Apache Ranger

*`NOTE: THESE STEPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE FOR YOU, THIS SECTION WILL WALK YOU THROUGH HOW PERMISSIONS/POLICIES ARE MANAGED IN RANGER. PLEASE DO NOT EXECUTE THE STEPS IN THIS SECTION OR CHANGE ANYTHING.`*

==== Step 1.2.1: Accessing Apache Ranger +

Click on the `Management Console` icon. +

Verify if the user group `workshop-users` (all users are part of this group) who will be performing the workshop is present in both `all-consumergroup` and `all-topic`. +

The below image reflects the group `workshop-users` being part of `all-consumergroup`. +

The below image reflects the group `workshop-users` being part of `all-topic`. +

==== Step 1.2.3: Schema Registry Permissions +
In Ranger, select the `SCHEMA-REGISTRY` repository that’s associated with the stream messaging datahub. +
image:images/step1/1-2-3-1.PNG[]  +

Verify if the user group `workshop-users` (all users are part of this group) who will be performing the workshop is present in the Policy: all - `schema-group, schema-metadata, schema-branch, schema-version`. +

//=== Step 1.3: Obtain the Kafka Broker List

//We will require the broker list to configure our processors to connect to our Kafka brokers which allows consumers to connect and fetch messages by partition, topic or offset. This information can be found in the Datahub cluster associated to the Streams Messaging Manager. Later in the lab, we will need to have at hand the list of kafka brokers - already configured in this environment- so to be able to our dataflow to publish to our Kafka topics.

//Access the Data Hub: Go to the environment that is shared by the INSTRUCTOR (Ex: `emeaworkshop-environ`). +
//image:images/step1/1-3-1.PNG[]  +

//Click on the DataHub associated with Streams Messaging Manager (Ex: `kafka-smm-cluster-emea`). +
//image:images/step1/1-3-2.PNG[]  +

//Go to the `Streams Messaging Manager` Interface. +
//image:images/step1/1-3-3.PNG[]  +

//Select `Brokers` from the left tab. +
//image:images/step1/1-3-4.PNG[]  +

//Save the name of the broker list in a notepad. +
//image:images/step1/1-3-5.PNG[]  +

//Example +
//`kafka-smm-cluster-emea-corebroker2.emeawork.dp5i-5vkq.cloudera.site:9093` +
//`kafka-smm-cluster-emea-corebroker0.emeawork.dp5i-5vkq.cloudera.site:9093` +
//`kafka-smm-cluster-emea-corebroker1.emeawork.dp5i-5vkq.cloudera.site:9093` +




=== Step 1.3: Download Resources from GitHub
Scroll up the page here (https://github.com/DigitalSal/cdf-workshop-aws) and click on `<> Code` and then choose the option `Download ZIP`. +

Use any unzip utility to download extract the content of the partner-summit-2023-main.zip file. +
image:images/step1/1-4-2.PNG[]  +
image:images/step1/1-4-3.PNG[]  +

In the extracted content just be sure that the downloaded files has a file `syslog-to-kafka.json` which should be around ~24 KB in size. You will need this file in later step. +
